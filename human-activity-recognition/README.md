# Human Activity Recognition with OpenCV and Deep Learning
- Repository for [Human Activity Recognition with OpenCV and Deep Learning](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/11/25/human-activity-recognition-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/) tutorial.

## Additional Notes
- Downloaded the ONNX model as per download_models.py from [HERE resnet-34_kinetics.onnx](https://www.dropbox.com/s/065l4vr8bptzohb/resnet-34_kinetics.onnx?dl=1')
- Human Activity Recognition model requires at least OpenCV 4.1.2.
